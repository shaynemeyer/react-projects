# Tanstack Query (formerly known as React Query)

Tanstack Query is a state management library that simplifies the process of fetching, caching, and updating data in React applications. Its major benefits include automatic background refetching, caching and stale data management, error handling, and easy pagination and infinite scrolling. Compared to setting up requests with useEffect, React Query provides a more declarative and centralized approach to managing data in React, which results in cleaner and more efficient code. It also reduces boilerplate code and improves performance by minimizing unnecessary re-renders and network requests.

## Install

```sh
npm i @tanstack/react-query
```

---

## Setup React Query

main.jsx

```js
import { QueryClient, QueryClientProvider } from "@tanstack/react-query";
const queryClient = new QueryClient();

ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root")).render(
  <QueryClientProvider client={queryClient}>
    <App />
  </QueryClientProvider>,
);
```

---

## First Query

Items.jsx

```js
import { useQuery } from "@tanstack/react-query";

const result = useQuery({
  queryKey: ["tasks"],
  queryFn: () => customFetch.get("/"),
});
console.log(result);
```

- Query Key

The unique key you provide is used internally for refetching, caching, and sharing your queries throughout your application.

- Query Function

A query function can be literally any function that returns a promise. The promise that is returned should either resolve the data or throw an error.

## Error Handling

```js
const Items = () => {
  const { isLoading, data, error, isError } = useQuery({
    queryKey: ["tasks"],
    queryFn: async () => {
      const { data } = await customFetch.get("/something");
      return data;
    },
  });

  if (isLoading) {
    return <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem " }}>Loading...</p>;
  }

  if (isError) {
    return <p style={{ marginTop: "1rem " }}>there was an error...</p>;
  }

  return (
    <div className="items">
      {data.taskList.map((item) => {
        return <SingleItem key={item.id} item={item} />;
      })}
    </div>
  );
};
export default Items;
```

---

## Create Task

Form.jsx

```js
const { mutate: createTask, isLoading } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (taskTitle) => customFetch.post("/", { title: taskTitle }),
});

const handleSubmit = (e) => {
  e.preventDefault();
  createTask(newItemName);
};
```

---

## useMutation Helper Options

useMutation comes with some helper options that allow quick and easy side-effects at any stage during the mutation lifecycle. These come in handy for both invalidating and refetching queries after mutations

```js
const { mutate: createTask, isLoading } = useMutation({
  mutationFn: (taskTitle) => customFetch.post("/", { title: taskTitle }),
  onSuccess: () => {
    // do something
  },
  onError: () => {
    // do something
  },
});
```
